## Want to contribute?
Awesome! Please fork this repo and submit a pull request when you’re done.

### Usage
After you’ve cloned the repo and `cd`ed into the project directory, run `npm install`. npm will install all dependencies, and an npm script will create a `certs/` directory for you and generate self-signed certificates.

### Running the application locally
`npm run watch` will launch the application locally. You can view it in your browser at <https://localhost:8080>. If your browser is worth the storage it’s written on, it’ll warn you about the certificates. This is normal, as they’re self-signed on your machine. Just follow whatever link it tells you is `(not recommended)`.
